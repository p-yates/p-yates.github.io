# Sketch Swap (Previously 'Colorblind Drawing Experience')

I origionally created this app for the 2024 Swift Student Challenge (where I won a prize) to showcase how colorblindness can impact people's lives. The app aims to foster empathy and raise awareness about the challenges faced by colorblind individuals. I clearly remember the difficulties as a small child a school having to color in drawings and not knowing what the colors were. Fortunately my parents knew I was colorblind, and therefore so did I and my teachers, but many do not until later in life. 

Users can draw and color using a palette of colors filterd to appear as they do for a color blind person (with deuteranomaly), highlighting the daily difficulties faced by people with colorblindness.

After drawing users can then swap the colors to 'normal' and reveal the differences in perception between colorblind and conventional vision.

I hope this can be an educational tool for parents, teachers, friends, and ayone interested in seeing how others with colorblindness experience the worls in one small way.
